 <p>let's discuss me. Everyone loves to talk about themselves. I grew up in New Jersey (Don't judge)I have been all over though and most of my life I've spent in Colorado.</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>New York City</li>
        <li>Colorado</li>
        <li>Missouri</li>
        <li>Florida</>
        <li>North Carolina</li>
        
    </ul>
   
 <p> I am an outdoorsy women. I love to ski and hike with my 11 year old Labradoodle, Goldie. My son Jeffery is 21 and lives in Fayetteville, A.R. Music and movement are a must have in my life. I miss going to see music this year. A piece of me is missing. I hope by the end of this course we'll be somewhat back to normal.</p>
